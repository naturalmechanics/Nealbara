Investigations of the Atmosphere using Cansats


1. Source / Inspiration of Codes

While the data transfer module between the components is my work, the solvers and many models are based on OpenFoam and/or Fluidity.

2. Using the code
-----------------

Neither Openfoam nor Fluidity is required. The base component (Nealbara - named after the ancient ocean around Vaalbara) is the only requirement. With Nealbara, one can load models, solvers, and constraints, and execute them. Everything runs with C/C++ with some python. Any modern Unix machine should be enough to handle this. In fact, I dont plan any support for windows.
